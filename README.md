Welcome,

this is my new project on rails. I just start coding right now. I start study this framework for sure. I hope, I will get some job ;). Sorry for the quality of my English.

See you soon ;)


## Support & Documentation

I use cloude9. It's for lerning and trying some stuff. Do not expect miracles.
